This was a fun first foray into Python(and ducktyping).
There are some pretty major differences and 
practices between this and what I'm used to in C++. I would've liked to build a view as well as a report 
on the invalid data members in the set. I also wouldve done more unit testing. I didnt get as many cases 
as I should have.
